The CRM *Feature Plugin* is part of the Grails CRM application framework. It manages installed features and
makes it possible to enable and disable features for different user accounts.

Each Grails CRM plugin can add features to an application. It does so by communicating with *CrmFeatureService* to add
metadata about what features the plugin provides.

As application developer you can enable or disable specific features provided by plugins.
You can also let administrators browse the plugin metadata and let them decide if they
want to enable the provided functionality.
